# Count Items Matching a Rule

## Description

You are given an array `items`, where each
`items[i] = [typei, colori, namei]` describes the type, color, and name of
the `i`th item. You are also given a rule represented by two strings,
`ruleKey` and `ruleValue`.

The `i`th item is said to match the rule if one of the following is true:

- `ruleKey == "type"` and `ruleValue == typei`.
- `ruleKey == "color"` and `ruleValue == colori`.
- `ruleKey == "name"` and `ruleValue == namei`.

Return the number of items that match the given rule.

### Example 1

```text
Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "color", ruleValue = "silver"
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one item matching the given rule, which is ["computer","silver","lenovo"].
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","phone"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "type", ruleValue = "phone"
Output: 2
Explanation: There are only two items matching the given rule, which are ["phone","blue","pixel"] and ["phone","gold","iphone"]. Note that the item ["computer","silver","phone"] does not match.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= items.length <= 10⁴`
- `1 <= typei.length, colori.length, namei.length, ruleValue.length <= 10`
- `ruleKey` is equal to either `"type"`, `"color"`, or `"name"`.
- All strings consist only of lowercase letters.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Iterate on each item, and check if each one matches the rule according to
the statement.
