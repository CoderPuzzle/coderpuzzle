# Check if Binary String Has at Most One Segment of Ones

## Description

Given a binary string `s` without leading zeros, return `true` if `s`
contains at most one contiguous segment of ones. Otherwise, return
`false`.

### Example 1

```text
Input: s = "1001"
Output: false
Explanation: The string has two segments of size 1.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: s = "110"
Output: true
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s[i]` is either '0' or '1'.
- `s[0]` is '1'.

## Hints

### Hint 1

It's guaranteed to have at least one segment

### Hint 2

The string size is small so you can count all segments of ones with no
that have no adjacent ones.
